            <h2>Privacy Policy Summary</h2>

            <p>BudgetSheet may collect certain non-personally identify
            information about you as you use our sites and apps. We may use
            this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this
            data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not
            individuals. We may also collect certain personal information about
            you and your use of the Service (as defined herein) which may be
            published and used in the aggregate as set forth in this Privacy
            Policy.</p>
            <p>We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you’ll
            always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we
            won’t do anything evil with it.</p>
            <p>We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store
            these.</p>
            <p>That’s the basic idea, but you must read through the
            entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before
            you use any of our sites.</p>

            <h2>Reuse</h2>
            <p>This document is based upon the <a
              href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Automattic Privacy
              Policy</a> and is licensed under <a
            href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative
            Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5</a>.</p> <p>BudgetSheet
            makes available services include our Google Sheets Add-On, our web sites
            (http://budgetsheet.net (the “Site”)), our blog, our API, and any
            other software, sites, and services offered by BudgetSheet in
            connection to any of those (taken together, the “Service”). It is
            BudgetSheet’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any
            information we may collect while operating our Site.</p>

            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact
            us at info@actridge.com</p>

            <h2>Visitors</h2>
            <p>Like most website operators, BudgetSheet collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
            type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
            each visitor request. BudgetSheet’s purpose in collecting
            non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
            BudgetSheet’s visitors use its website. From time to time,
            BudgetSheet may release non-personally-identifying information in
            the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
            of its website.</p> <p>BudgetSheet also collects potentially
            personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses. BudgetSheet does not use such information to identify
            its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information,
            other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also
            collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms
            of Service.</p>

            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Certain visitors to BudgetSheet’s websites choose to interact
            with BudgetSheet in ways that require BudgetSheet to gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
            information that BudgetSheet gathers depends on the nature of the
            interaction. BudgetSheet collects such information only insofar as
            is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s
            interaction with BudgetSheet. BudgetSheet does not disclose
            personally-identifying information other than as described below.
            And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
            information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging
            in certain Service-related activities.</p> <p>Additionally, some
            interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional
            personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may
            provide a website that will be displayed along with a user’s name
            when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information
            is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and
            the convenience of the user.</p>

            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
            <p>BudgetSheet may collect statistics about the behavior of
            visitors to and users of the Service. For instance, BudgetSheet may
            monitor the most popular parts of the BudgetSheet Site. BudgetSheet
            may display this information in the aggregate publicly or provide
            it to others.</p> <p>BudgetSheet does not disclose
            personally-identifying information other than as described
            below.</p>

            <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>BudgetSheet discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
            information in order to process it on BudgetSheet’ behalf or to
            provide services available at BudgetSheet’ Site websites, and (ii)
            that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
            employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
            outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to
            the transfer of such information to them. BudgetSheet will not rent
            or sell potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
            employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
            above, BudgetSheet discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only when required to do so by
            law, or when BudgetSheet believes in good faith that disclosure is
            reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
            BudgetSheet, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
            registered user of the Service and have supplied your email
            address, BudgetSheet may occasionally send you an email to tell you
            about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
            date with what’s going on with BudgetSheet and our products. We
            primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of
            information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
            If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
            one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it
            in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help
            us support other users. BudgetSheet takes all measures reasonably
            necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
            alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information.</p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
            visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the
            Service each time the visitor returns. BudgetSheet uses cookies to
            help BudgetSheet identify and track visitors, their usage of
            BudgetSheet Service, and their Service access preferences.
            BudgetSheet visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
            their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before
            using BudgetSheet’s websites, with the drawback that certain
            features of BudgetSheet’s websites may not function properly
            without the aid of cookies.</p>

            <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
            <p>If BudgetSheet, or substantially all of its assets, were
            acquired, or in the unlikely event that BudgetSheet goes out of
            business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the
            assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
            acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of
            BudgetSheet may continue to use your personal information as set
            forth in this policy.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p>BudgetSheet uses third party vendors and hosting partners to
            provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and
            related technology required to run the Service. You understand that
            although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on
            third party storage and transmitted through third party
            networks.</p>

            <h2>Google API Use</h2>
            <p>BudgetSheet makes extensive use of the Google Drive, Google
            Sheets, and other Google APIs as part of its core services. You may
            wish to read the <a
            href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy
            Policy</a> to understand how Google uses data it recieves.</p>

            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, BudgetSheet may
            change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in BudgetSheet’s
            sole discretion. BudgetSheet encourages visitors to frequently
            check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.</p>
